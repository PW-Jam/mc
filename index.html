Sam: I’ve been thinking about our lesson on modern communication. The teacher mentioned aggressive behaviour online, and I finally saw what she meant last night.
</voice>

<voice name="en-US-Standard-C">
Rachel: Oh, you mean the haters? I see aggressive behaviour every time I open Instagram.
</voice>

<voice name="en-US-Standard-B">
Sam: Exactly! I was looking at a post about a local girl group, and the comments were horrible and rude. Some people were calling one of the members “the ugliest artist” and saying she should quit. It was so aggressive and mean. I felt so bad for her; those people have no empathy at all.

<voice name="en-US-Standard-C">
Rachel: I agree. It’s incredibly toxic. But Sam, to be honest, I’m struggling with social media too. I spend hours just watching Reels on Instagram. Sometimes I don't even know what I’m watching. I just keep scrolling. I think I’m an addict. I’m such a heavy user. How about you?
</voice>

<voice name="en-US-Standard-B">
Sam: Hours? You’re probably addicted to IG. No wonder you are always saying you have no time for homework. I’ve never been a heavy user. Um, I guess I’m not even a moderate one. I’m sure I’m a light user. I spend less than an hour on social media because those Reels or posts are less attractive than playing basketball. Rachel, I’m glad you are aware of the problem.

<voice name="en-US-Standard-C">
Rachel: When I look at my poor school results, I know I have to break the habit. Besides the poor performance at school, I’ve become so impatient lately. I keep checking my posts every minute because I care too much about the number of likes I get. If the number is low, I feel embarrassed.
</voice>

<voice name="en-US-Standard-B">
Sam: If you think it’s a problem, you have to confront it. When it becomes an internet addiction, it’s not okay. If it affects your studies and your mood, what can you actually gain from these platforms?
</voice>

<voice name="en-US-Standard-C">
Rachel: You’re right. I’d like to focus on my studies, and I miss the time when I did my homework and actually chatted with my friends. Therefore, I’ve started setting a timer for IG. My parents are very appreciative of that because I’m finally focusing on my schoolwork and healthy activities instead of my phone.
</voice>

<voice name="en-US-Standard-B">
Sam: That’s why we need to be responsible users. We have to exercise self-control.
</voice>

<voice name="en-US-Standard-C">
Rachel: Exercise self-control. Yeah, I need to do that. I don't want to be impatient and anxious all the time. I want to be a trustworthy student who actually finishes her homework.
</voice>

<voice name="en-US-Standard-B">
Sam: Good. If we use it wisely, we can enjoy the benefits. But if we don't, the cons will definitely outweigh the pros.
